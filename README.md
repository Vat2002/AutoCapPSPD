# Image Captioning System

## Overview
This repository contains an innovative image captioning system that leverages the power of VGG16 for feature extraction, YOLO for object detection, and a GPT model for generating descriptive captions. This system is designed to understand the context of an image by analyzing its visual elements and generating a coherent and relevant caption that reflects the image's content.

## Architecture
The system integrates three main components:
- **VGG16 Model:** Used for extracting rich feature representations from the input images.
- **YOLO Model:** Identifies and extracts objects within the images, providing a detailed understanding of the visual elements present.
- **GPT Model:** Takes the combined insights from VGG16 and YOLO to generate a natural language caption that accurately describes the image.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
